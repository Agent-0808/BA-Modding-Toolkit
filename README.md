# BA Modding Toolkit

> Sorry for my program being written in Chinese without i18n support, but I believe it's easy to use with this README.

[简体中文](README_zh-CN.md) | English

A toolkit for automating the creation and updating of Blue Archive Mod Bundle files.

## Getting Started

### Install Python
Please ensure that Python 3.8 or higher is installed.

You can download and install Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

When you run `python --version` in the console, you should see something like `Python 3.12.4`.

### Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
If you encounter a `Failed building wheel` error in this step, please try using a slightly older version of Python, such as Python 3.13 or 3.12.

### Run the Program
```bash
python main.pyw
```
Alternatively, you can double-click the `main.pyw` file to launch the program.

If the program fails to start, please try running commands below in the console to check if the environment is configured correctly. 
```bash
python maincli.py env
```

## Program Interface Description
The program contains multiple functional tabs:
- **Mod 更新** (Mod Update): Update or port Mod files between different platforms
    - **单个更新** (Single Update): Update a single Mod file
    - **批量更新** (Batch Update): Batch process multiple Mod files
- **CRC 修正工具** (CRC Fix Tool): CRC checksum correction functionality
- **资源打包** (Asset Packer): Pack asset files from a folder into a Bundle file, replacing the corresponding assets in the Bundle
- **资源提取** (Asset Extractor): Extract specified types of assets from Bundle files
- **JP/GB转换** (JP/GB Conversion): Convert between JP server format and Global server format

Click the **Settings** button at the top of the main interface to open the advanced settings window.
The program can save user configurations to the `config.ini` file, which will be automatically restored upon next startup.

### Settings Interface

![Settings](assets/help/gui-help-settings-en.png)

#### Directory Settings
- **游戏根目录** (Game Root Directory): Set the game installation directory. The program can automatically detect resource subdirectories
- **输出目录** (Output Directory): Set the save location for generated files

#### Global Options
- **CRC 修正** (CRC Fix): Automatically corrects the Bundle file's CRC checksum, preventing the file from being rejected after modification
    - Currently only required for Steam version Mods, can be ignored for other versions
- 添加私货: Add `0x08080808` before CRC correction. ~~You can ignore it lol~~
- **创建备份** (Create Backup): Creates a backup of the original file before overwriting it
- **压缩方式** (Compression Method): Select the compression method for Bundle files (LZMA, LZ4, Keep Original, No Compression)

#### Asset Type Options
- **Texture2D**: Illustrations, textures, image assets
- **TextAsset**: `.atlas`, `.skel` files, Spine animation skeleton files
- **Mesh**: 3D model assets
- **ALL**: All types of assets, including those not listed above (experimental, not recommended)

#### Spine Converter (Experimental Feature)
Uses a third-party program to convert older Spine 3.8 format to the currently supported 4.2 format.
- You need to download the third-party Spine converter program yourself. BAMT only calls the program to convert Spine files, not provides the program itself.
- Download URL: [SpineSkeletonDataConverter](https://github.com/wang606/SpineSkeletonDataConverter/releases)
- Configure the path to `SpineSkeletonDataConverter.exe` in the settings interface, and check the "启用 Spine 转换" (Enable Spine Conversion) option.

**Note**: This is an experimental feature, not all mods can be successfully upgraded, suitable only for advanced users.

## How to Use

![How to update a mod with BAMT GUI](assets/help/gui-help-mod-update-en.png)

- First, open the Settings window and configure the game root directory and output directory.
- If you are updating or creating a Mod for the Steam version, check the "CRC 修正" (CRC Fix) option.
- It is recommended to check the "创建备份" (Create Backup) option to prevent accidental overwriting of original files.
- Click the "Save" button to save the configuration, which will be automatically restored upon next startup.

### Mod 更新 (Mod Update)
#### 单个更新 (Single Update)
1. Drag and drop or browse to select the old Mod Bundle file that needs to be updated
2. The program will automatically find the corresponding target Bundle file in the resource directory
3. Check the asset types that need to be replaced in the settings window
4. Click the "开始一键更新" (Start One-Click Update) button, the program will automatically process and generate the updated Bundle file
5. (Optional) After success, click "覆盖原文件" (Overwrite Original File) to apply the modifications. Please ensure the "创建备份" (Create Backup) option is enabled to prevent risks.

This feature can also be used to port mods between different platforms, just select the Bundle file from the corresponding platform in step 2.

#### 批量更新 (Batch Update)
1. Drag and drop or browse to select a folder containing multiple Mod files, or directly drag and drop multiple Mod files
    - The 4 buttons below are: 添加文件 (Add a File), 添加文件夹 (Add a Folder), 移除选中 (Remove Selected), 清空列表 (Clear List).
2. The program will automatically identify and list all processable Mod files
3. Configure asset types and other options in the settings window
4. Click the "开始批量更新" (Start Batch Update) button, the program will process all selected Mod files in sequence

### CRC 修正工具 (CRC Fix Tool)
1. Drag and drop or browse to select the target Bundle file that needs to be modified
2. The program will automatically find the corresponding original Bundle file in the resource directory
3. Click the "运行 CRC 修正" (Run CRC Fix) button: automatically corrects the Bundle file's CRC checksum
4. (Optional) After success, click "替换原始文件" (Replace Original File) to apply the modifications. Please ensure the "创建备份" (Create Backup) option is enabled to prevent risks.

The "计算CRC值" (Calculate CRC Value) button can be used to manually view the CRC checksum of a single file or two files.

### 资源打包工具 (Asset Packer)
1. Drag and drop or browse to select the folder containing assets to be packed
    - Supported file types: `.png` (textures), `.skel`, `.atlas` (Spine animation files)
    - Ensure asset filenames match the asset names in the target Bundle file
2. Drag and drop or browse to select the target Bundle file that needs to be modified
3. Click the "开始打包" (Start Packing) button: performs the asset packing operation
4. (Optional) After success, click "覆盖原文件" (Overwrite Original File) to apply the modifications. Please ensure the "创建备份" (Create Backup) option is enabled to prevent risks.

This feature is for creating new Mods, such as quickly packaging modified assets into Bundle files.

### 资源提取 (Asset Extractor)
1. Drag and drop or browse to select the Bundle file to extract assets from
2. Select an output directory, the program will automatically create a subdirectory named after the Bundle file
3. Check the asset types to extract in the settings window
4. Click the "开始提取" (Start Extraction) button, the program will automatically extract the specified types of assets

This feature is for extracting assets from existing Bundle files for modification or analysis.

### JP/GB转换 (JP/GB Conversion)
Conversion between JP server format (two files) and Global server format (one file).

#### JP -> Global Conversion
1. Select the Global server Bundle file (as the base file)
2. Select the JP TextAsset Bundle and Texture2D Bundle files
3. Click the "开始转换" (Start Conversion) button, the program will extract assets from the two JP server Bundles and merge them into the Global server version file

#### Global -> JP Conversion
1. Select the Global server Bundle file (source file)
2. Select the JP TextAsset Bundle and Texture2D Bundle files (as template)
4. Click the "开始转换" (Start Conversion) button, the program will split the Global server format Bundle into the two JP server Bundle files

## Developing

The author's programming skills are limited, welcome to provide suggestions or issues, and also welcome to contribute code to improve this project.

You can add `BA-Modding-Toolkit` code (mainly `processing.py` and `utils.py`) to your project or modify the existing code to implement custom Mod creation and update functionality.

`maincli.py` is a command-line interface (CLI) version of the main program, which you can refer to for calling processing functions.
